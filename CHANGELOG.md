# Changelog

All notable changes to the Gainium Technical Indicators library will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- `EMA` and `RMA` seeded their first value from one input too few. Both
  are seeded with the simple average of their first `interval` inputs,
  but the running total that average was built from was only updated
  while the history buffer was *not yet* full — and the input that fills
  the buffer is the `interval`-th one. So the total held `interval - 1`
  inputs and was still divided by `interval`, starting the average low
  by a factor of `(interval - 1) / interval` for a positive series. The
  seed is now the average of the filled buffer, which includes that last
  input. `EMA(3)` of a constant series of 10s is now `10` from its first
  value; it used to start at `6.67`.
- `EMA(1)` and `RMA(1)` returned `NaN` for every input, because the
  buffer fills on the very first one and the running total was never
  initialised. They now return the input, which is what `alpha = 1`
  means.
- A missing value (`NaN`) inside the first window no longer poisons the
  average permanently. The first value now simply arrives once
  `interval` clean inputs are in a row. A `NaN` after the first value is
  still `NaN` for that bar, and the average then restarts the same way
  instead of silently continuing from its stale previous value.

### Changed

- **Indicator values in the first bars after a start change, and so do
  backtest results over short windows.** Those were the wrong ones. The
  error was largest at the first value (`1 / interval` in relative
  terms — about 11 % at `interval = 9`, 0.5 % at 200) and decayed over
  roughly the average's own time constant, so how much of it an
  indicator ever showed depended on how much history was loaded in front
  of it. Anything with a long warm-up had decayed to nothing before its
  first output; a start on a short history had not.
- Affected, because they are built on `EMA` or `RMA`: `ATR` and the
  ATR-based settings, `MACD`, `DEMA`, `TEMA`, `SuperTrend`, Bollinger
  and Keltner channels on an EMA basis, `MAR` on an EMA/RMA basis, the
  volume oscillator, the divergence indicator and the TradingView-style
  technical-analysis rating.
- **Not** affected, confirmed value-for-value against the previous
  release: `SMA`, `WMA`, `HMA`, `CCI`, and — despite being Wilder
  indicators — `RSI` and `ADX`, which smooth with `WSMA`. `WSMA` seeds
  itself from a real `SMA` instance and was always correct.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- CI now runs a real `npm test` (mocha) on every PR. The `"test"` script
  was previously the default npm placeholder that always failed;
  `test/placeholder.spec.ts` is a stand-in until real coverage lands.

- RSI percentile calculations now use the correct percentage value instead of defaulting to 50th percentile

## [1.0.1] - 2025-05-30

### Fixed
